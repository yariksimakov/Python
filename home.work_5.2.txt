Hello. My name is Yaroslav.

Wikipedia (English Wikipedia, pronounced [?w?k??pi?di?] or [?w?ki?pi?di?]) is a publicly available multilingual universal Internet encyclopedia with free content [comm. 2], implemented on wiki principles. Located at wikipedia.org.

The site is owned by the American non-profit organization Wikimedia Foundation, which has 37 regional offices. The name of the encyclopedia is derived from the English words wiki ("wiki"; in turn borrowed from the Hawaiian language, in which it means "quickly") and encyclopedia ("encyclopedia").
